The data for the joining tasks is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ananta/credit-card-data) and contains synthetic (fake) credit card information and transactions. The data for the `tidyr` tasks is also synthetic.

<br>
**Question 1**

Read in all 4 credit card transaction datasets and clean column names.


<br>
**Ans. 1**

```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(janitor)
# library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# read CardBase csv file and Use janitor to clean names
card_base <- read_csv("data/CardBase.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

# show names
names(card_base)

```


```{r}
# read CustomerBase csv file and Use janitor to clean names
customer_base <- read_csv("data/CustomerBase.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()


# show names
names(customer_base)
```

```{r}
# read FraudBase csv file and Use janitor to clean names
fraud_base <- read_csv("data/FraudBase.csv")%>% 
  clean_names()

# show names
names(fraud_base)
```



```{r}
# read TransactionBase csv file and Use janitor to clean names
transaction_base <- read_csv("data/TransactionBase.csv")%>% 
  clean_names()

# show names
names(transaction_base)
```


**Question 2**

Join the data containing card details and customer details by customer id, so that all records of card details and any matching records in customer details are kept. Before you run the code, think about how many rows you expect to see after joining.

<br>
**Ans. 2
```{r}
left_join(card_base, customer_base, "cust_id")
```


**Question 3**

Join the data containing fraud details with transaction details so all rows of both tables are kept. What does the resulting row number tell you?

<br>
**Ans. 3**
```{r}
full_join(fraud_base, transaction_base, "transaction_id")
```

**Question 4**

Join the data containing card details with transaction details so rows from the first which have matching ones in the second are returned, but only return rows in the first table once.

<br>
**Ans. 4**
```{r}
semi_join(card_base, transaction_base, by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id"))
```

## `tidyr`

**Question 5**

Read in `hat_observations` and separate `observation` into two columns, `hat_colour` and `hat_type`.

<br>
**Ans. 5**
```{r}
# read hat_observations.csv file and Use janitor to clean names
hat_observations <- read_csv("data/hat_observations.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()


# show names
names(hat_observations)
```

```{r}
# separate the observation variable into hat_colour and hat_type 
hat_observations %>%
  separate(observation, c("hat_colour", "hat_type"), sep = "," )

```


**Question 6**

Unite `day`, `month`, and `year` columns into a column called `date` using a suitable separator. Then find the date where the most berets were observed.

<br>
**Ans. 6**
```{r}
# separate the observation variable into hat_colour and hat_type 
# unite the day, month, year variables into a new one called date
hat_observations %>%
  separate(observation, c("hat_colour", "hat_type"), sep = "," ) %>% 
  unite(date, c(day, month, year), sep = "-") %>% 
  filter(hat_type == "beret") %>%
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(observation_count)) %>% 
  slice_max(total, n = 1)
```

## Joins

**Question 1**

Can you join all 4 datasets together so that you're left with a dataset that looks like below with **109 rows** and **12 columns**?

![](images/all_joined.png)
<br>
**Ans. 1**
```{r}
card_base %>% 
  inner_join(customer_base, by = "cust_id") %>% 
  inner_join(transaction_base, by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id")) %>% 
  inner_join(fraud_base, by = "transaction_id")

```


```{r}
# My way
# join_card_cust <- left_join(card_base, customer_base, "cust_id")
# join_fraud_trans <- left_join(fraud_base, transaction_base, "transaction_id")
# 
# right_join(join_card_cust, join_fraud_trans, by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id"))
```


## `tidyr`

**Question 2**

Read in `exam_scores` and transform it into long format with two new columns `exam_question` and `score`. Then, using `separate` and `select`, remove superfluous information from the values in `exam_question`

<br>
**Ans. 2**
```{r}
# read exam_scores.csv file and Use janitor to clean names
exam_scores <- read_csv("data/exam_scores.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()


# show names
names(exam_scores)
```


```{r}
# gather the question columns into a new one `exam_question` and associated scores in `score`
exam_scores_long <- exam_scores %>%
  pivot_longer(cols =  starts_with("exam_q"), 
               names_to = "exam_question", 
               values_to = "score")

exam_scores_long
```

```{r}
# separate the exam_question variable so you only have the question number 
exam_question_separated <- exam_scores_long %>%
  separate(exam_question, c("exam", "question"), sep = "q" ) %>% 
  select(id, question, score)

exam_question_separated
```
