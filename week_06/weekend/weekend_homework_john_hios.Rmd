## Hypothesis testing - practical

You work for an animal conservation organisation and are looking to do some investigating into some of the animals to provide evidence for some projects you are looking to run. 

In this homework we'll use the `msleep` data set provided in the `ggplot` package. It concerns the sleeping patterns of various types of mammal.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(msleep)
```

<br>

**Question 1.**  
Explore the dataset and familiarise yourself with it.

<br>

**Ans 1.**

Load libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```

View data
```{r}
data(msleep) 

glimpse(msleep)
```

Check data  for NA values
```{r}
msleep %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x))))

```

**Question 2.**  
Jabberwockies sleep for around 7 hours a night, on average. Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the mean `sleep_total` in the sampled population of animal types differs from the typical value for jabberwockies.

<br>

**Ans 2. **

View histogram and box plot of `sleep_total`
```{r}
msleep  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_total)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 1) +
  xlim(0, 22)

msleep  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_total)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlim(0, 22)
```

Mean sleeping hrs of sample (observed statistic)
```{r}
observed_stat <- msleep %>%
  summarise(mean_sleep = mean(sleep_total))

observed_stat
```


The hypothesis test: 

$$ H_{0}: \mu_{sleep\_total} = 7 \\ 
H_{a}: \mu_{sleep\_total} \neq 7 $$ 


Calculate the null sampling distribution:
```{r}
# specify that we want to look at sleep_total variable, 5000 reps, and want to calculate the mean
null_distribution <- msleep %>%
  specify(response = sleep_total) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 7) %>%
  generate(reps = 5000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```


Visualise the null distribution and plot observed statistic:
```{r}
null_distribution %>%
  visualize(bins = 30) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat$mean_sleep, direction = "both")
```

Calculate p-value
```{r}
p_value <- null_distribution %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat$mean_sleep, direction = "both")
p_value
```

This outcome (p=0) is no surprise. The mean `sleep_total` in the sampled population of animal types differs significantly from the typical value for jabberwockies (see histogram above). 


<br>

**Question 3.**  
Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether omnivores sleep for significantly longer than herbivores, on average.

<br>

**Ans 3.**

Let’s start by setting a significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05, and the hypothesis test (one-tailed): 

$$ H_{0}: \mu_{omnivore} - \mu_{herbivore} = 0 \\ 
H_{a}: \mu_{omnivore} - \mu_{herbivore} > 0 $$ 


First we create a tibble to feed in `infer`.
```{r}
msleep_hrs <- msleep %>% 
  filter(vore == "omni"| vore == "herbi") %>% 
  select(vore, sleep_total)

head(msleep_hrs)
```

Let’s visualise the distributions and check the sizes of both samples.
```{r}
msleep_hrs %>%
  group_by(vore) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```


```{r}
msleep_hrs %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = sleep_total, x = vore)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
There's a considerable amount of overlap, and not any clear indication that omnivores sleep for significantly longer than herbivores, on average.

We generate the null distribution using permutation to create a distribution where there is no relationship between sleep hrs and mammal vore i.e. they are independent.

```{r}
null_distribution <- msleep_hrs %>% 
  specify(sleep_total ~ vore) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 5000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("omni", "herbi")) 

head(null_distribution)
```

Calculate our observed statistic and then visualise the null distribution and where the observed statistic lies on the distribution.
```{r}
observed_stat <- msleep_hrs %>% 
  specify(sleep_total ~ vore) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("omni", "herbi"))
  
observed_stat
```


Judging from $H_a$ we see that this is a one-tailed test because alternative is that the difference is greater than zero i.e. right direction.
```{r}
null_distribution %>%
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
```
We see from the visualisation that the observed statistic is not on the tail of our null distribution and so it looks likely we will not be rejecting $H_0$. To confirm this, let’s calculate the p-value.
```{r}
p_value <- null_distribution %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "left")

p_value
```
Since our p-value is greater than $\alpha$ =  0.05 we fail to reject $H_0$. There is not enough evidence to say that the omnivores sleep on average more hrs than the herbivores.


<br>

**Question 4. **
Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the proportion of domesticated animal types in the population of animal types is greater than $5\%$.
<br>
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Think about creating an `is_domesticated` variable for the analysis
</details>


<br>

**Ans 4.**

Remove NAs from conservation variable
```{r}
msleep_conservation <- msleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(conservation))
```

So let’s take a look at the proportion of domesticated mammals in the sample. 
```{r}
msleep_conservation  %>%
  group_by(conservation) %>%
  summarise(prop = n()/nrow(msleep_conservation)) %>%
  filter(conservation == "domesticated")
```

In the sample the proportion of domesticated mammals is 18.5%. This is significantly larger than 5%.


Let’s start by setting a significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05, and setting up our hypotheses:
$$H_{0}: \pi_{domesticated} = 0.05 \\ H_{\alpha}: \pi_{domesticated} > 0.05$$
Let’s calculate the observed statistic, the proportion of domesticated mammals. 
```{r}
msleep_conservation_prop <- msleep_conservation %>%
  mutate(conservation_flag = if_else(conservation == "domesticated", "domesticated", "not_domesticated"))
```


Now generate the null distribution. The value π0 we put in here should be the one assuming $H_0$ is true.
```{r}
null_distribution <- msleep_conservation_prop %>%
  specify(response = conservation_flag, success = "domesticated") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.05) %>%
  generate(reps = 5000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

head(null_distribution)
```

Calculate the observed statistic.
```{r}
observed_stat <- msleep_conservation_prop %>% 
  specify(response = conservation_flag, success = "domesticated") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")

observed_stat
```


Let’s visualise this distribution and overlay the observed statistics. 
```{r}
null_distribution %>%
  visualise(bins = 10) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "greater")
```

Calculate the p-value.
```{r}
p_value <- null_distribution %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "greater")

p_value
```
Since our p-value is less than $\alpha$ = 0.05 we reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_a$. Based on the available data, the proportion of domesticated mammals is greater than 5%.

## Hypothesis testing - Defining the Hypothesis 

For the following three business problems write out:

* What kind of test you would use  
*  $H_0$ and $H_a$ in **both** mathematical notation and in words. 
* Also state the method you would use to generate the null distribution (bootstrap, permutation or simulation). 

<br>

**Question 1.**  
You work for a independent coffee shop. The boss tells you that she thinks that around $40\%$ of people in the town (population $30,000$) know of the coffee shop, but you are skeptical of the estimate. You conduct a random survey of $200$ people in the town, asking if respondents are aware of your coffee shop. You want to use the sample to test the hypothesis that $40\%$ or more of the town's population have heard of the coffee shop. 

<br>

**Ans 1.**

* What kind of test you would use: One-sample proportion, right-sided.  

*  $H_0$ and $H_a$ in **both** mathematical notation and in words:

The math notation is:
$$H_{0}: \pi_{awareness} = 0.4 \\ H_{\alpha}: \pi_{awareness} > 0.4$$
We want to investigate whether the population proportion that knows about the coffee shop ($\pi_{awareness}$) is significantly larger from 40%.

The question is framed in terms of two competing hypotheses. The null hypothesis states that the current proportion is the same as the given value of 40%. The alternative states that the current proportion is larger than 40%.

* Also state the method you would use to generate the null distribution (bootstrap, permutation or simulation): We would ``draw`` the null distribution.

<br>

**Question 2.**  
You work for a website design company and have performed an **A/B test** on the position of a banner on a website promoting a particular item. 
<br><br>
<div class='emphasis'>
**A/B testing** 
A method comparing two versions of a web page, email, flyer or other marketing device against each other to determine which version performs better. As it is essentially a controlled experiment, the design should try to ensure that the groups experiencing both versions of the marketing device are equivalent and representative of the population.
</div>
<br><br>
You selected five days at random last month and then randomly selected $200$ of each sampled day's users into group $A$ and another $200$ of that day's users into group $B$. Group $A$ continued to be shown the banner at the right hand side of the webpage (its usual position) while group $B$ was shown the banner at the top of the page. You monitored each sampled user's interactions with the website, in particular the 'click through rate' (CTR) on the banner, i.e. what proportion of sampled users clicked on the banner. You want to use the sampled data to test the hypothesis that website users overall are more likely to click on the banner if positioned at the top of the page   
<br>

**Ans 2.**
* What kind of test you would use: Two means or proportions - independent samples.

* $H_0$ and $H_a$ in **both** mathematical notation and in words:

The math notation is:
$$H_{0}: \pi_{A} - \pi_{B} = 0 \\ H_{\alpha}: \pi_{A} - \pi_{B} < 0$$
We are comparing the 'click through rate' (CTR) on the banner from two independent samples A ($\pi_{A}$) and B ($\pi_{B}$) to test if the proportion of sample B $\pi_{B}$ is larger than sample A $\pi_{A}$ .

* Also state the method you would use to generate the null distribution (bootstrap, permutation or simulation): We would  randomly shuffle (i.e. permuting) the group labels.
<br>

**Question 3.**  
You work as an analyst for a car manufacturing company - they have specific standards they must meet for standards and regulation purposes. You have been asked to check the quality control of the manufacture of a particular car part. You have been given data on a sample of $200$ parts produced over the period of a week (the sampled parts were pulled at random from the production line and measured: the factory produced a lot more than $200$ parts that week). The specification of the part stipulates a width of $145\textrm{mm}$, and the manufacturing process is said to have 'drifted' if the mean width of parts differs significantly from $145\textrm{mm}$. You want to use the sampled measurements to test whether the process overall has drifted.     

<br>
**Ans 2.**
* What kind of test you would use: One-sample mean.

* $H_0$ and $H_a$ in **both** mathematical notation and in words:

The math notation is:
$$H_{0}: \mu_{0} = 145mm \\ H_{\alpha}: \mu_{0} \neq 145mm$$

We are comparing the mean from one sample ($\mu_{0}$) against a specified value of 145mm to infer if the mean width of parts differs significantly.


* Also state the method you would use to generate the null distribution (bootstrap, permutation or simulation): We would use a ``boostrap`` (sample with replacement) from our original sample.


## Hypothesis Testing - Interpreting the results

For the 3 business problems stated above, imagine we performed you got the following p-values (with the given significance levels) write out your interpretation of the results. 

<br>

**Question 1.**  

**Coffee shop problem**. Significance level: 0.05, calculated $p$-value: 0.07


<br>

**Ans 1.**
We fail to reject $H_0$. We do not have strong enough evidence to say that 40% of the town have heard of the coffee shop.

<br>

**Question 2.**  

**Website company problem**. Significance level: 0.01, $p$-value: 0.006

**Ans 2.**
We reject $H_0$ and accept $H_\alpha$. We have strong enough evidence that $\pi_{A} - \pi_{B} = 0$ is incorrect.

<br>

**Question 3.**  

**Manufacturing company problem**. Significance level: 0.05, $p$-value: 0.55

**Ans 3.**
We fail to reject $H_0$. We do not have strong enough evidence to say that $\mu_{0} = 145mm$ is incorrect.

## Market Basket Analysis

**Association rule mining** is regularly used by retailers to find associations between products that people purchase, perhaps for an online retailer, the items that people put together in their 'baskets', and in a bricks and mortar retailer, the items purchased together in a single transaction. The aim is to find recurring patterns in the transactions which the retailer can then use to do targeted marketing of items, seeking to increase 'cross sales'. Rules mining of this sort can also be used in other industries beyond retail to identify patterns in data. 

**Market basket analysis (MBA)** uses association rule mining. It looks at the association of items occurring in a **single basket**, and so won't look at your purchases over time, but only items that are purchased together in a single purchase (i.e. a 'basket'). As a good example, you may have seen the 'Frequently Bought Together' section on Amazon (and other sites), which looks at items you've got in your basket and suggests items that other people commonly have in their baskets when they also have these items:

```{r, echo=FALSE,, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/freq_bought_together.jpeg")
```

MBA differs from recommendation algorithms because the association rules look only at items bought together in a single purchase, they don't use any characteristics of the purchaser to profile them (e.g. 'Based on purchases by people like you, you may also like...') or how their purchases vary over time. The association rules used for MBA use the probability principles we learned on Monday this week. 

## Association rules 

The rules obtained by MBA have three concepts associated with them, as follows:

**Support**  
The probability of items in the rule being purchased together:

e.g. $\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B) = P(\textrm{A and B being purchased together}) = \frac{\textrm{number of transactions involving A and B}}{\textrm{total number of transactions}}$

Support also has meaning for single items:

e.g. $\textrm{sup}(A) = P(A) = \frac{\textrm{number of transactions involving A}}{\textrm{total number of transactions}}$

**Confidence**  
The proportion of purchases of $A$ where $B$ has also been purchased:

e.g. $\textrm{conf}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\textrm{P(A and B being purchased together)}}{\textrm{P(A being purchased)}}$

**Lift**  
Increase in sales of $A$ when sold with $B$

$\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B)}{\textrm{sup}(A) \times \textrm{sup}(B)}$

If $\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B) = \textrm{sup}(A) \times \textrm{sup}(B)$ then this means $P(A \textrm{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$. We know from the probability lesson earlier in the week that this means the purchase of $A$ and $B$ are independent events. This may help with our interpretation of lift values:

* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) \gt 1$ - items $A$ and $B$ are more likely to be bought together 
* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) = 1$ - no correlation between items $A$ and $B$ being bought together
* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) < 1$ - items $A$ and $B$ are unlikely to be bought together

A and B don't need to be single items, they could be sets of items (itemsets) e.g. A = {TV, DVD player}, B = {TV stand}. 

## Using the rules 

Once we have calculated the rules we can use them to gain insights about items/itemsets. 

For example, if for items $A$ and $B$ the corresponding rule $(A \rightarrow B)$ has a low support but a lift greater than $1$ then we can say that when $A$ is purchased $B$ is often purchased with it (high lift), but such transactions don't happen all that frequently (low support). 

The **apriori algorithm** is often used as a way of selecting 'interesting' rules. It will calculate all the support, confidence and lift values for the item/itemset combinations of your dataset and will return those with support values greater than a pre-defined threshold value set by the user. 

## Homework exercise

Let's load in some transaction data which has details on the items purchased in each transaction (where each transaction is uniquely identified by the `InvoiceNo` variable). 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
transactions <- read_csv("data/online_retail_subset.csv")
head(transactions, 20)
```

## Association rules 

For the first section we are interested in the purchase of two particular items:

* item $A$ - 'HEART OF WICKER SMALL' (`StockCode` $22469$) 
* item $B$ - 'LARGE CAKE TOWEL PINK SPOTS' (`StockCode` $21110$)

**Question 1.**  
Calculate the support for item $A$ (this will be the support for a single item)

**Question 2.**  
Calculate the support and confidence for rule $(A \rightarrow B)$. 

**Question 3.**  
Calculate the lift for $(A \rightarrow B)$

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
You will need to calculate the support for $B$]
</details>

## Apriori algorithm 

Read up on the `arules` and `arulesViz` packages, which make use of the 'apriori' algorithm http://www.salemmarafi.com/code/market-basket-analysis-with-r/comment-page-1/

Use these packages to play around, applying the apriori algorithm to the `transactions` dataset we have. 

To use the `arules` package we need the data to be a special type of 'transactions' object. We do this by reading in the data using `read.transactions()` function from the `arules` package. We have done this for you below (for more information on this type of transactions object see the helpfile `?transactions`):

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

```{r}
transactions_reformat <- transactions %>%
  select(InvoiceNo, Description) %>%
  na.omit()

write_csv(transactions_reformat, "transactions_reformat.csv")

apriori_format <- read.transactions("transactions_reformat.csv", format = "single", sep = ",", header = TRUE, cols = c("InvoiceNo", "Description"))

inspect(head(apriori_format))
```

Now you're all set to play around with `arules` and `arulesViz`. 

**Warning about run time/memory usage:** if the minimum support is set too low for the dataset, then the algorithm will try to create an extremely large set of itemsets/rules. This will result in very long run times and the process may eventually run out of memory. You can either start by trying a reasonably high support (for this dataset, we would suggest starting at $1%$ and then systematically lower the support if don't see any results). There is also an argument `maxtime` which can be used to prevent long run times (more information on that in the `apriori` user document [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/arules/man/apriori.html)).
